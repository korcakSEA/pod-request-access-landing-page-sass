### Useful resources

- [Figma Design for beginners](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/30880632542743-Figma-Design-for-beginners) - This helped me understand how to read a Figma file.

- [Managing forms with JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-and-validate-beautiful-forms-with-vanilla-html-css-js/) - I gained a more professional approach to form validation.
